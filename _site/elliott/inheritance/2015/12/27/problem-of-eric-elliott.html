    <p>Eric Elliott is well known JavaScript programmer and blogger. He is advocate of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>favor object composition over class inheritance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mantra in JavaScript - famous and correct sentance from “Gang of Four” book. He is also author of such words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If constructor behavior is the frying pan, classical inheritance isn’t the fire; it’s the fire from Dante’s seventh circle of hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He proposed a solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I settled on an interesting idea: a factory function that helps you produce factory functions that you can inherit from and compose together. I called the composable factories “stamps,” and the library, “Stampit.” (…) or simply cloning objects by copying properties from a source object to a new object (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object.assign()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">$.extend()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">_.extend()</code>, etc…).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many JS developers refer to his ideas to implement such approach in their own programming journeys.</p>

<p>However, there is one small problem:</p>

<p><strong>Eric Elliott completely misunderstands what object composition is and he is using misrepresented and twisted terms in his posts.</strong></p>

<p>How it could be? I had not realized this too until I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3oy9c3/composition_vs_eric_elliott/">this</a> post on Reddit (author’s <a href="https://medium.com/@jeffm712/">blog</a>). Author shows that what Elliott really means by <em>classical inheritance</em> is actually <em>not multiple inheritance</em>, and what really Elliott thinks he solves by using StampIt or <code class="highlighter-rouge">_.extend()</code> is actually form of <em>multiple inheritance</em> not a form of <em>object composition</em>.</p>

<p><strong>So Elliott thinks he is using object composition when he really is using multiple inheritance.</strong></p>

<p>Definition of <em>object composition</em> from “Gang of Four” (to which Elliot is referring):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object composition is defined dynamically at run-time through objects acquiring references to other objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example (object contains has-a relationships):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">author</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">createAuthor</span><span class="p">(),</span>
  <span class="nx">posts</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="nx">createPosts</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Definition of <em>inheritance</em> (from Wikipedia, but is industry standard):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object (prototypal inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), using the same implementation (inheriting from an object or class) specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior (realizing an interface; inheriting behavior).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence using <em>_.extend()</em> or <em>Stampit</em> is a form of <em>inheritance</em> (multiple), because we are inheriting behaviors and components interfaces become your interface. It does not matter that they do it by shallow copying.</p>

<p>Moreover, <em>multiple inheritance</em> suffers from some problem, called “diamond problem” (from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“diamond problem” is an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>_.extend()</em> or <em>Stampit</em> “solve” this problem by just overwriting methods of the same name by last object in the call.</p>

<p>Author of Reddit’s post shows how <em>Stampit</em> gives completely unexpected results due to this problem:</p>
